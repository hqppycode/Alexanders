        Every bride wants their dream wedding. Unfortunately, most of the time
        money stands in the way for making that dream a reality. At least,
        that's the way it was for Mike and Tina Alexander when they were
        planning their wedding in 1990. They did not have the money to pay
        someone for an elaborate wedding, so instead they made their dream
        wedding happen themselves. They planned everything from the food to the
        decor. It turned out beautifully and the guests loved it! On May 5,
        1990, the day of their wedding, Mike decided he wanted to help other
        brides make their dream wedding a reality, thus, Alexander's the Great
        Events was created. And for 25 years the goal has not wavered: to make
        every event a great event!
