        <p class="our-story">
          Every bride wants their dream wedding. Unfortunately, most of the time
          money stands in the way for making that dream a reality. At least,
          that's the way it was for Mike and Tina Alexander when they were
          planning their wedding in 1990. They did not have the money to pay
          someone for an elaborate wedding, so instead they made their dream
          wedding happen themselves. They planned everything from the food to
          the decor. It turned out beautifully and the guests loved it! On May
          5, 1990, the day of their wedding, Mike decided he wanted to help
          other brides make their dream wedding a reality, thus, Alexander's the
          Great Events was created. And for 25 years the goal has not wavered:
          to make every event a great event!
        </p>
